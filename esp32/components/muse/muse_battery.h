 * Battery meter, for power work. None of the boards can measure current, so a
 * measurement pairs the fuel gauge (1% steps) with what the chip did: how long
 * the screen was off, how long it really spent in light sleep, and, with
 * CONFIG_PM_PROFILING, how long a core was busy and which power locks kept
 * it awake. A measurement starts when USB is unplugged (or at boot on
 * battery) and stops when USB comes back, keeping its numbers until the next.
 * On the bench, ">nap" on USB measures from then until the board wakes.

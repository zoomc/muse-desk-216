/*
 * Talking to Muse.
 *
 * Muse holds one HTTP-over-Noise connection to its VM (the transport
 * Home Link uses) and runs each push-to-talk turn over it, entirely on the VM:
 *   speech -> POST /api/voice/dictation (streamed 24 kHz PCM, NDJSON transcripts)
 *   text   -> POST /chat/stream, reply events on POST /chat/subscribe
 *   reply  -> text, shown at reading pace (start_tts in muse_chat_session.cpp
 *             is where a TTS API of your own would plug in)
 *
 * Credentials: a device token, exchanged through the Muse API for the VM's own
 * token. If the account API rejects it and a VM ID is set, the token is tried
 * as that VM's token directly.
 *
 * Without CONFIG_MUSE_HATCH (no PSRAM) the same API is backed by
 * muse_chat_link.c: the note rides Home Link's session to its paired VM and
 * replies come back as text only (no audio from turn_read). Captions retain
 * up to 1,023 UTF-8 bytes; at most two completed messages await processing.
 * Bursts can omit older messages; subscription lines above 12 KiB are skipped.
 * Use the Muse app for the full conversation.

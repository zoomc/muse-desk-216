# Devices

These are the boards the ESP32 Device SDK runs on. Each board is an `sdkconfig`
overlay: a short file of settings loaded on top of
[`../sdkconfig.defaults`](../sdkconfig.defaults) that picks the chip, flash,
memory, button, and how the device shows its status. The ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1 is
the default and needs no overlay.

Every board pairs with the Muse app, joins your Wi-Fi, and holds an encrypted
session to Muse. The rest depends on the hardware.

Boards without PSRAM (the ideaspark, the C6 boards, the Cardputer ADV and the AI Passport) don't have room for
the home-network tunnel. Muse can still reach and control them once the
control session is up. The Waveshare C6, Cardputer ADV and AI Passport also can't hold their own voice
session, so push-to-talk sends your voice note over its control session to the
Muse it's paired with, and the reply scrolls past as text. It can't show images either: the UI holds a whole image in
PSRAM, where the ideaspark draws one straight to its screen.

The Waveshare 7-inch board is a display and touch gadget with no built-in
microphone or speaker. Tap the screen to confirm pairing in the Muse app.
The backlight has an on/off switch rather than dimming control. Its BOOT key
shares GPIO0 with the RGB panel, so it is reserved for entering the bootloader
and is not a Muse input while the display runs.

The SenseCAP Indicator's sensors hang off its RP2040, which passes the
readings to the ESP32-S3. The D1S and D1Pro have CO2 and tVOC sensors built
in, and temperature and humidity come from the Grove AHT20 in the box (plug it
in). Muse reads them all at once with `sensors.read`. This needs Seeed's stock
RP2040 firmware.

The reTerminal E1001's e-paper shows only black and white, 1 bit per pixel,
and keeps its picture without power. It shows a still status screen (the
agent's name, the character and a line of status text) that changes only when
the status does, since each refresh takes a second or two. Images from Muse are dithered
to black and white on the device and refresh once they are all in, with a
brief black-and-white flash. `display.draw_url` tells Muse the bit depth.

The reTerminal E1002 is the same board with a six-colour E Ink Spectra 6
panel: black, white, yellow, red, blue and green, 4 bits per pixel. It shows
the same status screen, with the character in colour. Images from Muse are
dithered to those six inks on the device (grays to black and white only),
and each refresh takes about 30 seconds and flashes. `display.draw_url` tells
Muse the six exact colours, the resolution and how slow it is.

Both reTerminals have an SHT4x temperature and humidity sensor on board,
which Muse reads with `sensors.read`. The board warms the sensor a little, so
the temperature is corrected by `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_RETERMINAL_SHT4X_TEMP_OFFSET`
(in tenths of a degree, -3.3 °C by default).

The SenseCAP Watcher keeps its factory data (the identity SenseCraft uses) in
an `nvsfactory` partition at `0x9000`, where Muse puts its partition table and
NVS. It's unique to each Watcher, so back it up before you flash Muse the first
time. To return to Seeed's firmware, flash it and then write the backup back:

```sh
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0x9000 0x32000 nvsfactory.bin
tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0x9000 nvsfactory.bin
```

The Watcher's CH342 USB bridge corrupts reads at 921600 baud and above, so
these use esptool's default of 115200. It also drops bytes when a whole packet
arrives at once, so plain esptool can't upload its stub or write flash
(`0107: Checksum error`, `0105: The format of the received message is
invalid`). `tools/muse/paced_esptool.py` takes esptool's arguments and sends 64
bytes at a time at the line rate; `tools/muse/board.sh flash watcher` uses it.

The M5Stack StickS3 has 8 MB of flash, so it uses its own partition table with
two smaller app slots. The front button is push-to-talk and the side button
steps through the menu, as on the AIPI. Powering off from Muse turns off the
screen, speaker and codec and puts the ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button
wakes it. Double-click the power button for a full power-off, and click it to
turn back on. Muse turns off the power chip's green LED, which would otherwise
stay lit. The IMU, IR and Grove port aren't used yet.
[M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) is M5Stack's reference
driver for the power chip and peripherals.

M5Stack ships the StickS3 with UiFlow2, which hands the ESP32-S3's USB to its
own driver and switches off the chip's USB serial port, so esptool can't find
it. The power chip drives the boot pin (GPIO0), so there's no BOOT button
either. To flash Muse the first time, put UiFlow2 in USB mode, open its REPL
(for example with `mpremote repl`) and paste:

```python
import machine; m = machine.mem32
m[0x600C001C] = m[0x600C001C] | (1 << 10)                 # USB serial clock on
m[0x600C0024] = m[0x600C0024] & ~(1 << 10)                # and out of reset
m[0x60038018] = 0x4200                                    # its pads on
m[0x60008120] = (m[0x60008120] | (1 << 20)) & ~(1 << 19)  # give it the USB pins
```

The REPL stops answering. Unplug the USB cable and plug it back in (the
battery keeps the stick running), and it shows up as a USB JTAG/serial port.
Anything that resets the stick now boots UiFlow2 again, so pass
`--after no-reset` to esptool until Muse is on. Back up the flash, then flash
Muse:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT --after no-reset read-flash 0 0x800000 sticks3.bin
tools/muse/board.sh flash sticks3 PORT
```

Muse keeps the USB serial port on, so later flashes need none of this. To go
back to UiFlow2, write the backup:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT write-flash 0 sticks3.bin
```

The M5Stack StopWatch has the same CO5300 round AMOLED as the Waveshare S3
1.75C, with a CST820 touch controller and the StickS3's ES8311 audio. The
yellow button (upper left) is push-to-talk and the blue one (upper right) puts
the screen to sleep; settings are on the touch screen. Powering off from Muse
turns off the screen, touch, audio and the expander's L3B rail and puts the
ESP32-S3 in deep sleep; either button wakes it. Double-click the power button
for a full power-off, and click it to turn back on. M5's IO expander (M5IOE1)
switches the panel and touch resets, audio power and the amp; its power chip
(M5PM1) reads the battery and the charger. The IMU, RTC, vibration motor and
Grove port aren't used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified)
and M5's [factory firmware](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StopWatch-UserDemo)
are the references. It enumerates as the chip's own USB serial port, so
flashing needs nothing special: `tools/muse/board.sh flash stopwatch`.

The M5Stack CoreS3 runs on Espressif's
[BSP](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/m5stack_core_s3),
which brings up its ILI9342C LCD, FT6336U touch, AW88298 amp and ES7210
microphones and switches the AXP2101's rails for each of them. It has no user
button: PWR on the left side is push-to-talk and pairing confirmation, read
from the AXP2101's key interrupts (its hardware power-off moves to a 10 s
hold), and settings are on the touch screen (swipe left from Muse). RST on the
bottom edge restarts the board, and holding it for 3 s enters the bootloader.
Powering off from Muse switches the AXP2101 off; click PWR to turn it back on.
Its 1 W speaker is quiet, so the volume starts at 100%. The camera, proximity
sensor, IMU, RTC, SD card and Grove ports aren't used yet. It enumerates as the
chip's own USB serial port: `tools/muse/board.sh flash cores3`. If esptool
can't connect, hold RST for 3 s, until the green LED lights, to enter the
bootloader.

The M5Stack StickC Plus2 runs the full UI on a classic ESP32, as does the Core2
below. It has
8 MB of flash and 2 MB of PSRAM, so it uses the 8 MB partition table too. The
front button is push-to-talk and the side button steps through the menu. The
power button wakes the screen, and holding it for 2 s powers off. There's no
power chip: the power button switches the stick on and the ESP32 keeps it on
(GPIO4). Powering off lets go of that, which cuts the power on battery. On
USB the stick stays powered, so the ESP32 also goes into deep sleep, and the
front or power button wakes it. Muse speaks through a small passive buzzer,
so replies are quiet. The battery shows its voltage, but the stick can't tell
Muse whether it's on USB or charging. The IMU, IR, RTC and Grove port aren't
used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) and
[M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) are M5Stack's reference drivers
for the pins and peripherals.

The Plus2's console is a CH9102 USB-UART bridge, which drops out above
230400 baud, so `tools/muse/board.sh flash plus2` uses 230400. It comes with
M5Stack's factory firmware. Back up the flash before you flash Muse for the
first time:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32 -p PORT -b 230400 read-flash 0 0x800000 plus2.bin
```

To go back, write the backup with `write-flash 0 plus2.bin`, using the same
chip, port and baud.

## M5Stack Core2 port

Core2 v1.0 (AXP192 PMU), using Espressif's `m5stack_core_2` BSP.
The 2.0" touch LCD shows the avatar UI: hold the middle bottom touch zone (M5's BtnB) to talk, navigate
the rest on screen. Holding PWR would cut the power in hardware past about
4 s, so the side power button is aux instead: tap to sleep or wake, and
hold for a clean shutdown on the PMU long-press event. Pairing presses are
confirmed by tapping the touch zone.
Settings, battery telemetry, images and the home-network tunnel all work.
Menu power-off shuts down through the PMU, and PWR turns the board back on.
Core2 v1.1 uses the AXP2101 PMU and is not supported by this port; the board's
back sticker or PCB identifies the revision. The IMU, RTC, vibration motor
and SD slot aren't used yet. [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified)
and [M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) are M5Stack's reference drivers
for the pins and peripherals, and the display, touch and speaker setup follows
Espressif's [BSP](https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/m5stack_core_2).

The console is a CP2104 or CH9102F USB-UART bridge (early units the former,
later ones the latter), so `tools/muse/board.sh flash core2` uses 230400
baud, which both take. Back up the flash before you flash Muse for the first
time:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32 -p PORT -b 230400 read-flash 0 0x1000000 core2.bin
```

To go back, write the backup with `write-flash 0 core2.bin`, using the same
chip, port and baud.

## Guition JC3248W535

The JC3248W535 (sold as JC3248W535C_I_Y and JC3248W535EN) is a 3.5" 320×480
IPS panel on an AXS15231B, driven over QSPI, with the controller's own
capacitive touch on I2C. In QSPI mode the AXS15231B ignores the row address,
so a write can only start at the top of the screen or carry on from the last
one: the board renders LVGL in direct mode into one full-screen buffer in
PSRAM and sends every frame whole. The panel's init sequence is the one
Arduino_GFX uses for this board.

It has an NS4168 I2S amp with a JST 1.25 connector for a 4-8 Ω speaker, but no
microphone. Push-to-talk records silence until you add an I2S MEMS mic such
as an INMP441: SCK to GPIO42 and WS to GPIO2 (shared with the amp), L/R to
GND, VDD to 3.3 V, and SD to a free GPIO, which you set as
`CONFIG_MUSE_JC3248W535_MIC_GPIO` under **Muse** in `menuconfig`. BOOT is the
only button: push-to-talk, pairing confirmation, and waking the screen. Power
off puts the chip in deep sleep until BOOT is pressed; there's no battery
gauge.

It enumerates as the chip's own USB serial port. Back up the stock firmware
before flashing Muse for the first time, and restore it with
`write-flash 0 jc3248w535.bin`:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0 0x1000000 jc3248w535.bin
tools/muse/board.sh flash jc3248w535 PORT
```

## Waveshare ESP32-C6-Touch-AMOLED-2.06

Use the `c6-206` profile for this watch; `c6` remains the 1.8-inch board.
The 2.06-inch model has different display/touch wiring, an ES7210 with two
microphones, and an AXP2101 power chip. PWR edges are read from the PMU;
BOOT (GPIO9) is
push-to-talk and pairing confirmation. Tap PWR to turn the screen off or
wake it, and hold it for 1.5 seconds to power off.

```sh
tools/muse/board.sh build c6-206
tools/muse/board.sh flash c6-206 /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

Set your SDK token in `build-muse-waveshare-c6-206/sdkconfig` before building
(see the main README). The board has 16 MB flash and no PSRAM, so it uses
Link's session for voice notes with text replies. Images, the home-network
tunnel, and spoken replies are not supported by this profile. The IMU and RTC
are not exposed by this port. Battery life and suspend behavior need on-device
measurement; this profile does not add automatic light sleep.

The v2.0.0 vendor BSP takes its draw-buffer height from Kconfig rather than
`bsp_display_cfg_t`. The overlay uses 8 lines instead of the 100-line default
and selects I2S0, the C6's only I2S peripheral. Keep these settings when
updating the BSP.

Before treating a build as hardware-validated, check cold boot and reboot,
all touch edges, BOOT/PWR press and release, BLE pairing, Wi-Fi reconnect,
several push-to-talk/text reply cycles, microphone levels, battery reporting,
charging, screen-off/wake, and software power-off. USB builds and host tests
alone cannot verify these behaviors.

## Cardputer ADV port

Experimental ADV-only port, tested with ESP-IDF 6.0.1. Supports the display,
keyboard, BLE/Wi-Fi pairing, voice notes and text replies.

- Hold **Space/GO** to talk. **Esc** opens/closes the menu or goes back;
  **Enter** selects and confirms pairing.
- **Up/Down** (`;`/`.`) navigate; **Left/Right** (`,`/`/`) change values,
  with or without Fn. Typing chat messages is not supported.
- Menu power-off enters deep sleep; **GO** wakes it. Use the side switch
  for physical power-off.

Replies may be shortened; use the Muse app for the full conversation.
Spoken replies, images, the home-network tunnel, battery telemetry and
extra peripherals (SD, IMU, IR, expansion) are not supported.

Set your SDK token in `build-muse-m5stack-cardputer-adv/sdkconfig` (ignored
by Git). Build with `tools/muse/board.sh build cardputer-adv` and flash with
`tools/muse/board.sh flash cardputer-adv PORT`. To enter download mode,
switch off, hold GO while connecting USB, then release GO.

Back up the original 8 MB firmware before flashing; keep it outside Git:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p PORT read-flash 0 0x800000 cardputer-adv-backup.bin
```

Restore with `write-flash 0 cardputer-adv-backup.bin`. Pair in Muse under
Settings > Devices > Developer mode > Add Device, then press Enter.

## Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16

The 2.16 port uses Waveshare's BSP for the square 480×480 CO5300 AMOLED, the
CST9220 touch controller and the ES8311/ES7210 audio codecs. Its three buttons
are on the top edge: KEY3 (right) is push-to-talk and pairing confirmation, PWR
(middle) talks too, and BOOT (left) is the aux button; settings use the
touchscreen. The IMU, RTC and TF card are not
integrated.

See [2.16 setup](waveshare-s3-216.md) for pins, the factory firmware backup,
and the hardware verification checklist.

## AI Passport port

Experimental port of FoloToy's ESP32-C3 wearable, tested with ESP-IDF 6.0.1.
Supports the display, buttons, BLE/Wi-Fi pairing, voice notes, text replies
(with `CONFIG_MUSE_CJK_FONT` for Chinese and Japanese) and the battery gauge.

- The three buttons on the right edge share one ADC ladder on GPIO0. Hold
  **OK** (the bottom one) to talk; it also confirms pairing. **DOWN** opens
  the menu and moves down it; **UP** moves up.
- Menu power-off enters deep sleep; any button wakes it.

The C3 has about 400 KB of SRAM shared between code and heap, and no PSRAM.
The overlay moves driver code out of IRAM and trims the BLE, Wi-Fi, TCP and
LVGL buffers so the UI, the Link session and a voice note fit together; the
session uses 12 KB inbound frames where the Cardputer ADV uses 17 KB. A reply
frame bigger than that shows "REPLY TOO LONG: SEE MUSE APP" and the session
reconnects. Replies may be shortened; use the Muse app for the full
conversation. Spoken replies,
images, the home-network tunnel, OTA and the charging state are not supported.

Set your SDK token in `build-muse-ai-passport/sdkconfig` (ignored by Git).
Build with `tools/muse/board.sh build ai-passport` and flash with
`tools/muse/board.sh flash ai-passport PORT`. The stock firmware's NVS layout
differs, so erase the flash first (`idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`) or the
firmware won't start. Back up the original 8 MB firmware before that; keep it
outside Git:

```sh
python -m esptool --chip esp32c3 -p PORT read-flash 0 0x800000 ai-passport-backup.bin
```

Restore with `write-flash 0 ai-passport-backup.bin`. Pair in Muse under
Settings > Devices > Developer mode > Add Device, then press OK.

## ESP32-S3-BOX-3

The BOX-3 port uses Espressif’s BSP for the LCD/touch hardware revisions and
the ES8311/ES7210 audio codecs. BOOT/CONFIG is push-to-talk and pairing
confirmation; settings use the touchscreen. The capacitive home button, dock
sensors, SD card, IR, and battery telemetry are not integrated. Power off
enters deep sleep; BOOT/CONFIG or RESET wakes the unit.

See [BOX-3 setup](esp32-s3-box-3.md) for PowerShell build and flash commands,
token setup, and the hardware verification checklist.

`tools/board.sh BOARD [build|flash|monitor|flash-monitor] [PORT]` builds each
board in its own `build-<board>` directory. For the boards with the full UI, run `idf.py`
with the target and overlays from the table:

```sh
idf.py -B build-muse-aipi -DIDF_TARGET=esp32s3 \
  -DSDKCONFIG=build-muse-aipi/sdkconfig \
  -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.muse;devices/sdkconfig.muse-aipi" build
```

To flash, add `-p PORT flash` with the same arguments. Boards with the full UI need 16 MB
of flash or more, except the StickS3, StickC Plus2, Cardputer ADV and AI Passport, whose overlays switch
to the 8 MB layout in [`partitions_muse_8mb.csv`](../partitions_muse_8mb.csv).
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) covers flashing, monitoring, and what to do when a
build picks up stale settings.

## Add a board

1. Copy the closest overlay here as `sdkconfig.<yourboard>`.
2. Set at least `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`, `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BUTTON_GPIO`, the status
   backend (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_*`), and the flash size and mode.
3. Without PSRAM, also turn off `CONFIG_SPIRAM` and `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_TUNNEL` and
   keep mbedtls in internal memory, as [`sdkconfig.ideaspark`](sdkconfig.ideaspark)
   does.
4. Build with `SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.<yourboard>"`
   and add your board to the tables above.

A board with a new kind of display, or one that runs the UI, needs code
as well. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) walks through every kind of board, from the
overlay to testing on hardware.

[Muse Gadgets Discord](https://discord.gg/3bhjCkZdd6).

### Watcher camera

Camera support is disabled by default. In the Watcher build's `menuconfig`,
under **Muse**, enable **SenseCAP Watcher camera capture and live preview**
(`CONFIG_MUSE_WATCHER_CAMERA=y`) and rebuild. It requires PSRAM. Disabled
builds omit the camera worker, shutter UI, double-click gesture, and
`camera.capture` command.

Double-click the wheel to open a live camera view. Aim the Watcher, then tap
**TAP TO TAKE PHOTO** or double-click the wheel again. The captured frame stays
on screen. Tap the image to return to the avatar.

The `camera.capture` command returns a JPEG in
`payload.data_base64`, with `payload.format` set to `jpeg-base64`. During live
preview it returns the latest frame. Otherwise it requests a fresh frame.
Capture runs asynchronously and reports initialization, timeout, or busy errors.
The camera uses the existing Himax firmware. It's powered only while a capture
or the live view runs (a capture takes under a second, start-up included), and
nothing polls it in between.
Photo attachments to voice messages are not included.

## reSpeaker Lite setup (experimental)

See [seeed-respeaker-lite.md](seeed-respeaker-lite.md) for the XMOS firmware requirement, build commands and controls.

## VN ESP32-S3 1.83-inch NV3023

A Vietnamese ESP32-S3R8 board with the Xingzhi Cube's 1.83" 284×240 NV3023
LCD, an ES8311 for the speaker and an ES7210 for the mics. It ships with
xiaozhi firmware, where it's `xiaozhi-ai-iot-vietnam-1st`. Pins, the panel's
init sequence and the battery levels follow that xiaozhi port
in [TienHuyIoT/xiaozhi-esp32_vietnam](https://github.com/TienHuyIoT/xiaozhi-esp32_vietnam)
(`main/boards/xiaozhi-ai-iot-vietnam-1st/`). BOOT is push-to-talk, Vol+
opens the menu and moves down it, Vol- moves up it (or back to the list from a
page), and BOOT selects. There's no touch, so set
it up over BLE. The battery shows as a percentage from the port's table, and
the charge pin (GPIO47) says when it's charging.

The mic is the ES7210's first channel (`mic_slot` 0); its second carries the
speaker reference that xiaozhi uses for echo cancelling. Power off is deep
sleep, and BOOT wakes it.

Coming from other firmware, erase the flash once before the first flash
(`idf.py -p PORT erase-flash`): Muse's NVS and `prod_data` partitions sit where
other firmware keeps its own data.

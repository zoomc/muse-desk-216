# ESP32 Device SDK

Flash this open source firmware onto any ESP32-compatible board to connect
Muse to your home Wi-Fi. On boards with the home-network tunnel, Muse can reach
the devices you already own and anything you build with a local HTTP API.

Then hack on it: add a display, a button, or support for a board we haven't
tried yet, and build your own Muse gadget.

> **Note:** Built by hackers, for hackers, just for fun. Flashing custom
> firmware can brick boards and void warranties. Proceed at your own risk!

## What you need

- **An ESP32 board.** The quickest start is the **ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1**, which
  works as-is with its built-in status light and BOOT button. The other boards
  that already work are listed [below](#boards).
- **A USB cable that carries data**, not just power.
- **A computer** running macOS or Linux.
- **An SDK token** from [gadgets.muse.ai](https://gadgets.muse.ai/settings/sdk-tokens)
  (Account > SDK tokens). Every gadget needs one to pair, including ones you
  build for yourself. Read the [Gadget SDK Terms](https://gadgets.muse.ai/sdk-terms)
  before you use it.
- **The Muse app** on your phone, to set up the device once it's flashed.

## Get going with Muse Code

The fastest way to build is to let [Muse Code](https://developer.meta.com/ai/lp/muse-code/)
do it. Install it:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://dev.meta.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Then plug in your board, and start Muse Code from this directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/muse-gadget-sdk
cd muse-gadget-sdk/esp32
muse --disable-sandbox
```

The first time, Muse Code asks you to trust the workspace and sign in.
`--disable-sandbox` lets it reach your board's USB serial port and download
the ESP-IDF toolchain. You still approve each command before it runs. Then ask:

> Build this firmware for my ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1 and flash it.

Muse Code reads [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), which has everything needed to set up
the toolchain, build for your board, flash it, and read its logs. From there,
keep going:

> Watch the serial log and tell me when it's ready to pair.

> I have a Waveshare ESP32-S3 AMOLED board. Build the UI for it.

> Add support for my board. It's an ESP32-S3 with 16 MB flash, a button on
> GPIO 0 and no PSRAM.

> Make the status light half as bright.

Other coding agents work too. Any agent that reads `AGENTS.md` can build and
flash from this repository. Flashing needs access to your board's USB serial
port, so if your agent runs in a sandbox, let it run the flash and monitor
commands outside the sandbox.

## Or do it yourself

### 1. Install ESP-IDF v6.0.1

This firmware is built with Espressif's ESP-IDF, **version 6.0.1**. Other
versions aren't supported. If you already have it installed, skip ahead.

On macOS, install the prerequisites first with `brew install cmake ninja
dfu-util python3`. On Linux, follow
[Espressif's prerequisites](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v6.0.1/esp32c5/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html).
Then:

```sh
git clone -b v6.0.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git ~/esp/esp-idf-v6
~/esp/esp-idf-v6/install.sh esp32c5,esp32s3,esp32c6,esp32
. ~/esp/esp-idf-v6/export.sh
```

Run the last line in every new terminal you build from.

### 2. Build

From this directory, set your SDK token, then build:

```sh
idf.py menuconfig   # ESP32 Device SDK > Muse Gadgets SDK token
idf.py build
```

This builds for the ESP32-C5 DevKitC-1. The firmware lands in
`build/muse-gadget.bin`.

### 3. Flash

Plug in the board and flash it:

```sh
idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 flash monitor
```

Replace the port with your board's. On macOS, `ls /dev/cu.usb*` lists the
connected ports; on Linux, look for `/dev/ttyACM*` or `/dev/ttyUSB*`. The
monitor shows the device's log; press `Ctrl-]` to quit. If flashing can't
connect, hold **BOOT**, tap **RESET**, release **BOOT**, and try again.

Reflashing keeps your pairing and Wi-Fi settings. To start completely fresh,
run `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash` first.

### 4. Set it up with Muse

Once flashed, the status light breathes **orange**: the device is ready for
setup. In the Muse app, turn on **Settings > Devices > Developer mode**, then
add the device (**Settings > Devices > Add Device**, the **+** icon in the top
right). It shows up as `MuseGadget-XXXXXX`. When the light breathes **blue**, press the **BOOT**
button to confirm it's really you. The light turns **green** when Muse is
connected.

| Light | What it means |
|---|---|
| Orange, breathing | Ready for setup |
| Blue, breathing | Press the button to confirm pairing |
| Blue | Joining Wi-Fi and connecting to Muse |
| Green | Connected |
| Yellow, blinking | Reconnecting |
| Purple | Not paired |
| Red, blinking | Something went wrong: check the log |

To reset the device and set it up again, hold the button for 5 seconds.

Pairing requires a press of the button on the device, and every setup creates
a fresh encrypted session. Because these are community devices, pairing has no
manufacturer verification and can't prevent an active man-in-the-middle
attack. Set it up on a network you trust.

## Boards

Boards marked UI run the full on-screen UI: an animated avatar, push-to-talk and
settings. Audio and image support vary by board, so check the feature table in
[`devices/`](devices). The others show status on a light, a ring or a simple
status screen.

`tools/board.sh BOARD [build|flash|monitor|flash-monitor] [PORT]` builds each
board in its own `build-<board>` directory with the right chip and settings.
Boards that support images can show pictures Muse sends them:
`tools/image_for_display.py` prepares a picture for the screen size.

Boards without PSRAM, like the classic ESP32 and the ESP32-C6, run without the
home-network tunnel, which needs more memory than they have. Muse can still
reach the device and control it.

## Hack and extend it

Every board's settings live in a small `devices/sdkconfig.<board>` file loaded
on top of `sdkconfig.defaults`. To add a board, copy the closest one and change
the chip, button pin, status light, and flash size.
[`devices/README.md`](devices/README.md#add-a-board) covers the details, or ask
Muse Code to do it for you.

To put your own avatar on a board's screen, plug in the board and run
`python3 tools/muse/avatar.py`. It asks your Muse to redraw its avatar as the
board's pixel avatar, checks the result, then builds and flashes it. Your avatar
stays out of git. See [`tools/muse/AVATAR_RECIPE.md`](tools/muse/AVATAR_RECIPE.md)
for how it works and for boards that need the manual steps.

To give Muse a command of its own, such as reading a sensor or switching a
relay, advertise it in `link.register` and handle it in `main/app.c`.
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md#adding-a-command) walks through it.

To work on the UI without a board, use the
[`simulator/`](simulator/README.md) desktop preview. It runs the production UI
and avatar renderer in a 412 x 412 SenseCAP Watcher window, supports mouse and
keyboard input, and can render scripted screenshots without a display server.

Replies from Muse are text: push-to-talk sends your voice note, Muse
transcribes it and answers in writing, and boards with a screen show the
answer as captions (Voice PE and reSpeaker Lite replies show up in the Muse app). Two
things you can change:

- **Shorter answers.** Ask for them in the message itself, such as "Answer in
  one sentence."
- **Spoken answers.** Send each reply's text to a text-to-speech API of your
  choice and play the audio it returns. On boards with PSRAM, `start_tts` in
  [`components/muse/muse_chat_session.cpp`](components/muse/muse_chat_session.cpp)
  is the spot: it has the reply text, and the MP3 decoder, speaker and volume
  are already wired up there.

A few things worth knowing:

- Your SDK token ships inside the firmware, so treat it as an identifier
  rather than a password. If it leaks, revoke it on gadgets.muse.ai, generate
  a new one, and rebuild.
- **We strongly recommend enabling NVS encryption** if your board supports it.
  NVS stores Wi-Fi credentials and device tokens in flash; without encryption,
  anyone with physical access to the board can read them. Enable it with
  `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_NVS_ENCRYPTION` in `idf.py menuconfig` (under "ESP32 Device
  SDK"). The encryption key is derived from an HMAC key in eFuse, which is
  generated automatically on first boot if the eFuse block is available.
- Builds are version `999.0.0`. Over-the-air updates are off by default; the
  boards that run the full on-screen UI turn them on. Change it with
  `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_OTA_ENABLED` in `idf.py menuconfig`, and set a version with
  `idf.py -DPROJECT_VER=1.0.0 build`.
- Each build keeps its generated settings in its build directory
  (`build/sdkconfig`). If you change `sdkconfig.defaults` or a board file,
  delete the build directory so the change takes effect.
- Builds are signed with the included development key and never turn on
  Secure Boot, so you can reflash your board as often as you like.

## Tests

The tests run on your computer, with no board attached:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run `idf.py build` once first so the downloaded components are in place.

Two crypto tests are skipped unless the host has what they need. Install the
host Mbed TLS library (`brew install mbedtls pkgconf` on macOS,
`apt-get install libmbedtls-dev pkg-config` on Debian or Ubuntu), and run the
tests from a terminal where you ran ESP-IDF's `export.sh`, which sets
`IDF_PATH`. The last line of the output shows `skipped=` if any were left out.

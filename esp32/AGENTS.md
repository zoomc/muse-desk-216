# AGENTS.md

How to build this firmware and flash it onto your own ESP32 board. See
`README.md` for a shorter human overview.

## What this is

The ESP32 Device SDK: the ESP-IDF firmware (`muse-gadget`) powering Muse
Home Link. It pairs with a phone over BLE, joins Wi-Fi, and holds an encrypted
Noise session to a VM, with an optional home-network tunnel. `main/main.c` is the entry
point and `main/app.c` holds most of the logic. `components/muse` adds a
avatar/voice/settings UI on boards with a display.

## Prerequisites

- **ESP-IDF v6.0.1**, installed and activated (`. $IDF_PATH/export.sh`) so
  `idf.py` is on `PATH`. Other versions are unsupported. Errors about missing
  IDF headers such as `gcm.h` or `gpio_ll.h` usually mean the wrong IDF tag.
- Python 3 and a C/C++ compiler (`cc`, `c++`) for the host tests.
- A USB data cable. Flashing needs access to the serial port. A sandboxed
  agent usually has to run flash and monitor commands outside the sandbox.

## Supported boards

Board overlays live in `devices/`, which has a `README.md` listing each board's
hardware, features, and where to buy it, and an `AGENTS.md` recipe for adding
one. Its Vendor sources table lists each vendor's code for its boards: read it
before adding a feature to one.

The default profile expects the C5 DevKitC-1: an addressable status LED on
GPIO27, the BOOT button on GPIO28 (active low), 8 MB flash and quad PSRAM.
The DevKitC-1's LED takes red first (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_RGB_ORDER`, on by
default). If yours shows green as red and amber as green, it takes green first
like most WS2812s: turn the option off in `idf.py menuconfig`, or in
`build-devkit/sdkconfig`, and rebuild.

## Build

Every build needs the user's SDK token (`mgst_…`, from gadgets.muse.ai >
Account > SDK tokens). Ask for it, then set `CONFIG_GADGET_SDK_TOKEN="mgst_…"`
in that build directory's `sdkconfig` (or with `idf.py menuconfig`) before
building. Without it the build warns, and the gadget will stop pairing once
Muse requires tokens. Never commit the token or print it in full.

### DevKitC-1 (default)

```sh
idf.py build                    # -> build/muse-gadget.bin, config in build/sdkconfig
```

### Other boards, with the helper

`tools/board.sh BOARD [build|flash|monitor|flash-monitor] [PORT]` sets the
target and overlays and gives each board its own `build-<board>/` directory
and `build-<board>/sdkconfig`:

```sh
tools/board.sh sensecap-indicator build
tools/board.sh ideaspark flash-monitor /dev/cu.usbserial-110
```

Without a port it uses the only matching serial port, and fails if it finds
none or more than one. If `idf.py` is not on `PATH`, it sources `export.sh`
from `$IDF_PATH`, `~/esp/esp-idf-v6.0.1`, `~/esp/esp-idf-v6` or `~/esp/esp-idf`.

### Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition

`tools/board.sh home-assistant-voice build` builds a status-and-voice gadget:
the LED ring shows the status colours, holding the centre button records a
voice note that Muse answers in the app, and the dial sets the speaker volume
(shown on the ring, kept across restarts). It advertises as
`MuseGadget-ha-voice-XXXXXX`.

- The console and flashing go through the S3's own USB-Serial-JTAG, which
  shows up as `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` like a DevKitC-1. With both plugged in, pass
  the port, and check it with `python -m esptool read-mac` before flashing.
- Flashing replaces the vendor firmware on the S3 only. The XMOS audio chip
  keeps its own firmware; never reflash it.
- While voice chat is ready, the centre button is push-to-talk. Turn the mute
  switch on to get its setup role back (pairing confirmation, the 5 s
  factory-reset hold).

### Boards with the full UI, by hand

`tools/muse/board.sh build|flash <s3|s3n|s3-216|aipi|box3|c6|c6-206|watcher|sticks3|plus2|cardputer-adv|stopwatch|cores3|core2|jc3248w535|lcd7|vn183|ai-passport> [SERIAL|PORT]`
builds one board in `build-muse-<profile>/`, logs to
`/tmp/muse_build_<board>.log`, and clears `managed_components/` before and
after so it doesn't clash with other boards. When flashing, it finds the
board's port with `tools/muse/ports.py`, by the USB device behind it rather
than the port name, which changes when boards are re-cabled. With several
boards of one kind attached, pass the device's USB serial number (on the chip's
own USB serial port, its MAC) or the port; `tools/muse/ports.py --list` shows
them. It finds ESP-IDF the way `tools/board.sh` does, trying
`~/.espressif/esp-idf-v6.0.1` first. For an install anywhere else, set
`IDF_EXPORT` to its `export.sh`, e.g. in your shell profile:
`export IDF_EXPORT=/path/to/esp-idf/export.sh`. `tools/muse/avatar.py` builds
through `board.sh`, so it needs the same.

For bench testing, `MUSE_BENCH=1 tools/muse/board.sh build|flash ...` adds
`devices/sdkconfig.muse-bench` and uses `build-muse-<profile>-bench/`. That
turns on screenshots: `tools/muse/snap.py PORT KEYS OUT.png` sends bench keys
and saves the screen, and `>face=thinking` (or `idle`, `listening`,
`speaking`, `error`, `boot`, `off`, `happy`) in KEYS picks the avatar mode first.
Screenshots are off in normal builds because each one takes a buffer the size
of the screen. `>face=` works in any build. Or run `idf.py` directly:

```sh
idf.py -B build-muse-aipi -DIDF_TARGET=esp32s3 \
  -DSDKCONFIG=build-muse-aipi/sdkconfig \
  -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;devices/sdkconfig.muse;devices/sdkconfig.muse-aipi" build
```

To flash, add `-p PORT flash` with the same `-B`, target and defaults
arguments, except on the SenseCAP Watcher: `idf.py flash` runs plain esptool,
which fails on its USB bridge (see "Flash it"). Build the Watcher with
`idf.py`, flash it with `tools/muse/board.sh flash watcher`, then
`idf.py … -p PORT monitor` as usual; reading from the bridge works. Muse builds use `partitions_muse.csv` and need 16 MB of flash or
more, except the StickS3, StickC Plus2, Cardputer ADV and AI Passport, which have 8 MB and use
`partitions_muse_8mb.csv`.

All boards share `managed_components/` and `dependencies.lock` in this
directory. If the component manager fails after you switch between a board
with the full UI and one without (lvgl is the usual offender), delete both and build again.

### A new board

Follow `devices/AGENTS.md`, which covers boards with a status light, a status
screen or the full UI from the overlay to verification. In short: copy the
closest overlay to `devices/sdkconfig.<yourboard>`, load it last, and add the
board to `devices/README.md`. At minimum set `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`,
`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_BUTTON_GPIO`, the LED backend (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_LED_BACKEND_*`,
or `..._NONE`), and the flash size and mode. Without PSRAM, also set
`CONFIG_SPIRAM=n`, `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_TUNNEL=n` and the mbedtls
internal-allocation options, as `devices/sdkconfig.ideaspark` does. Signed
apps on a classic ESP32 need chip revision 3.0 or later
(`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN_3=y`).

## Flash

### Identify the board first

When you're asked to flash, work out which board is attached instead of asking
which one it is or assuming the default. Say which board you found and what told
you, then flash that profile. Getting it wrong writes another board's pin map,
flash size and status backend.

1. **Ask the running firmware.** A board already running this firmware names
   itself, and this needs no guessing:

   ```sh
   python3 tools/muse/chat.py --status     # {"board": "M5Stack StickS3", ...}
   ```

   It also logs the name once at startup, as `muse: board: <name>`, which
   `tools/muse/monitor.py PORT` captures because it resets the board first.
   `components/muse/muse_app.c` logs it; each `components/muse/boards/board_*.c`
   sets its `.name`. Boards with the full UI only: the other overlays don't log a name.

2. **Read the USB descriptor.** This works with no write access to the port and
   whatever the board is running, including vendor firmware or nothing.
   `ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0` on macOS, `lsusb -v` or `udevadm info /dev/ttyACM0`
   on Linux:

   | Descriptor | Board |
   |---|---|
   | Espressif `303a:1001`, "USB JTAG/serial debug unit" | the chip's own USB: C5, C6, S3 and the S3 boards with the full UI. Its serial number is the MAC |
   | CH340 (`1a86:7523`) | ideaspark, SenseCAP Indicator, reTerminal E1001 and E1002 |
   | CH9102 | M5Stack StickC Plus2 |
   | CH343 (`1a86:55d3`), "USB Single Serial" | Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 |
   | CH342, two `usbmodem` ports | SenseCAP Watcher: the S3 console is the one ending in `3`, the other is the Himax camera |

3. **Ask the chip.** When you can write to the port (this resets the board):

   ```sh
   python -m esptool -p PORT chip-id      # read-mac for the MAC
   ```

   The target narrows it a long way: `esp32c5` is the DevKitC-1, `esp32c6` the
   Waveshare C6 or a C6 devkit, `esp32` the ideaspark or the StickC Plus2.

4. **Fall back to a read-only capture.** If the board is mid-run and you can't
   write to the port, the `## Monitor` recipe below reads it without resetting,
   and a talk press logs the board's own button name as `muse_input: waking
   (<hint>)`:

   | Hint | Board |
   |---|---|
   | `yellow` | M5Stack StopWatch |
   | `power` | M5Stack CoreS3 |
   | `front` | M5Stack StickS3, or StickC Plus2 — tell them apart by the port: the StickS3 is native USB, the Plus2 is a CH9102 `usbserial` |
   | `top` | Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C |
   | `key` | Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16 |
   | `bottom right` | AIPI Lite |
   | `wheel` | Seeed SenseCAP Watcher |
   | `boot` | Waveshare ESP32-C6-Touch-AMOLED-1.8, the ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75, the Guition JC3248W535 or the VN ESP32-S3 1.83-inch NV3023 — tell the C6 by its target (`esp32c6`), and the S3 boards by the `muse: board:` line a reset logs |

Ask the user only when these come up empty or contradict each other, and say
what you found and what's ambiguous rather than asking from scratch.

### Flash it

```sh
idf.py -p PORT flash                           # default DevKitC-1 build
tools/board.sh devkit flash PORT               # same, in build-devkit/
cd build && python -m esptool --chip esp32c5 -b 460800 \
  --before default-reset --after hard-reset write-flash "@flash_args"
```

Typical ports: `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` or `/dev/ttyACM*` for native USB (C5, S3 and
C6 boards), and `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`, `/dev/cu.wchusbserial*` or `/dev/ttyUSB*`
for CH340 bridges (ideaspark, SenseCAP Indicator, reTerminal E1001 and E1002). On Linux,
add yourself to the `dialout` (or `uucp`) group. If the chip won't enter the
bootloader, hold BOOT, tap RESET, release BOOT, and flash again.

The M5Stack StickC Plus2's CH9102 bridge shows up as `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` or
`/dev/ttyACM*`. It drops out above 230400 baud, so `tools/muse/board.sh`
flashes it at 230400.

The SenseCAP Watcher's bottom USB-C port has a CH342 bridge with two ports,
both `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS. The ESP32-S3 console is the second (ending
in `3`); the first is the Himax camera chip. Muse overwrites the Watcher's
factory data, so back up its `nvsfactory` partition first (see
`devices/README.md`).

The CH342 has no flow control and drops bytes when esptool sends a whole
packet at once, at any baud and on any USB port. Plain esptool then fails with
`Failed to write to target RAM (result was 0107: Checksum error)` while
uploading its stub, or `0105: The format of the received message is invalid`
on the first flash block, by which point it has erased the bootloader. That
leaves the Watcher unable to boot until a flash succeeds; the ROM loader still
answers, so it isn't bricked. `tools/muse/board.sh flash watcher` goes through
`tools/muse/paced_esptool.py`, which takes esptool's arguments and sends 64
bytes at a time at the line rate, at 115200 baud. Use it in place of
`python -m esptool` for anything that writes to the Watcher. A lower baud or
another USB port doesn't help. Pacing works with macOS's built-in driver, so
WCH's driver isn't needed.

`board.sh` prints only esptool's last three lines, so a Watcher flash shows
nothing for about three minutes. Don't interrupt it, which leaves the board
unbootable again. To watch the progress, run the wrapper from the build
directory:

```sh
cd build-muse-sensecap-watcher
python ../tools/muse/paced_esptool.py --chip esp32s3 -p PORT -b 115200 \
  --before default-reset --after hard-reset write-flash "@flash_args"
```

- `flash` writes the bootloader, the partition table (at `0x10000`, not the IDF
  default `0x8000`), otadata, phy_init and the app to `ota_0`. NVS is left
  alone, so pairing and Wi-Fi credentials survive a reflash.
- `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash` wipes everything, including pairing. Do this
  only when you mean to start from scratch.
- The app is signed with the committed `dev_signing_key.pem`, and Secure Boot
  is **not** enabled, so flashing never burns eFuses. Keep it that way: don't
  enable `CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT`, flash encryption, or
  `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_PAIRING_EFUSE_AUTH` on a board you want to keep reflashing.

## Monitor

`idf.py -p PORT monitor` (Ctrl-] to quit) resets the board and needs an
interactive terminal. An agent without a TTY can do a read-only capture that
doesn't reset the board:

```py
import os, termios, time
fd = os.open("/dev/cu.usbmodem1101", os.O_RDONLY | os.O_NOCTTY | os.O_NONBLOCK)
attrs = termios.tcgetattr(fd)
attrs[2] &= ~termios.HUPCL   # don't toggle DTR/RTS (which resets) on close
termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSANOW, attrs)
deadline = time.monotonic() + 10
while time.monotonic() < deadline:
    try:
        chunk = os.read(fd, 4096)
        if chunk:
            os.write(1, chunk)
    except BlockingIOError:
        time.sleep(0.05)
```

To capture from boot, use `tools/muse/monitor.py PORT [secs]`, which resets the
board first (it needs `pyserial`). A healthy boot logs
`link.main: Muse Gadget starting`. For a board with the full UI, `$(tools/muse/ports.py BOARD)`
gives the port, with BOARD as in `tools/muse/board.sh`.

## Update my avatar

When someone asks to put their own avatar on their board (or to update or
change it), run this from `esp32/` with the sandbox off (it uses the serial
port) and let it finish. It takes several minutes, mostly waiting for Muse:

```sh
python3 tools/muse/avatar.py                    # draw their avatar
python3 tools/muse/avatar.py --edit "CHANGE"    # change the one they have
```

It checks the board, asks their Muse for the renderer through the board,
saves it to `components/muse/avatar/muse_pixel.c` (gitignored), checks it on
the host, then builds and flashes. Progress and errors go to stderr. Relay the
line that starts with `Muse drew:` and the GIF paths. On failure, pass the
message on. The exit status says what kind of failure it was:

- **2**: no board, or it can't do this. If it says the board doesn't answer,
  rerun with `--board s3` or `--board aipi` (from the board's name, or ask) to
  flash firmware that can. On the C6 boards or Watcher, follow the manual steps in
  `tools/muse/AVATAR_RECIPE.md`.
- **3**: the board isn't on Wi-Fi, or it isn't paired in the Muse app and has
  no device token, so their Muse isn't connected. Tell them, and point them to
  the Muse app or `tools/muse/ble_setup.html`.
- **1**: Muse's file still fails after two fix rounds, or the build or flash
  failed. The previous avatar is in `muse_pixel.c.prev`, next to the new one.

Don't commit anything in `components/muse/avatar/`. To see what the board
says, run `python3 tools/muse/chat.py --status`. To ask their Muse something,
run `python3 tools/muse/chat.py "question"`.

The default avatar is in `avatar/`: its renderer (`muse_pixel.c`) and
its animation (`jollybot.gif`, and `happy_anim.c/.h` made from it by
`tools/gen_happy_anim.py`).

Third-party code keeps its upstream license and header: `minimp3.h` (CC0) and
`main/pixel_font.c` (BSD-2-Clause, Adafruit). Don't restyle them or replace
their headers with the Apache one; `components/minimp3/README.md` says how to
update minimp3.

The Apache License doesn't cover the Jollybot avatar in `avatar/`. Its files
carry only a Meta copyright line; don't add the Apache header to them.

## First boot and pairing

The status LED (or the edge bars or avatar on display boards) shows the state:

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| orange, breathing | BLE advertising, waiting for setup |
| blue, breathing | pairing needs a physical button press |
| blue | Wi-Fi or VM session coming up |
| green | connected (tunnel up, or control session up when the tunnel is off) |
| yellow, blinking | VM switching or connection lost |
| purple | unpaired |
| red, blinking | error |

Button (BOOT on the dev boards):

- **short press**: confirm a pending pairing, or reopen the setup window if
  setup isn't complete
- **hold for 5 s**: reset setup (unpair and forget Wi-Fi)

The device advertises as `MuseGadget-XXXXXX` (`MuseGadget-Disp-XXXXXX` on the
ideaspark, SenseCAP Indicator and reTerminal E1001 and E1002 overlays, `MuseGadget-ha-voice-XXXXXX` on the
Voice PE, `MuseGadget-respeaker-XXXXXX` on the reSpeaker Lite). It uses
**community pairing v5**, so the phone app must support v5
and list community devices. Community pairing needs the button press but has no
manufacturer attestation, and it doesn't stop an active man-in-the-middle.

Until it's paired, a board with the full UI shows that name on its screen, dim under the
state, so you can tell which gadget to pick in the Muse app. A screen too narrow
for the whole name shows the `XXXXXX` tail on its own, and a square 128 px
screen (AIPI Lite) leaves it out, the same as it leaves out the state. Once it's
paired (or has a token set by hand), the name goes, and the mic icon and the
touch boards' speaker button appear. They're hidden until then, since a press
can't reach Muse and there are no replies to mute.

To skip BLE Wi-Fi provisioning while you iterate, set
`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_WIFI_SSID` and `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_WIFI_PASSWORD` in `menuconfig`.
The device still needs to be paired once for its token.

## Configuration gotchas

- Each build's generated `sdkconfig` lives in its build directory
  (`build/sdkconfig`, `build-<board>/sdkconfig`). Once it exists, it overrides
  later edits to `sdkconfig.defaults` or the overlays. After changing those,
  delete the generated `sdkconfig` (or the whole build directory) and rebuild.
  `cmake/validate_config.cmake` stops the build if a stale config has the old
  TCP buffer sizes or cJSON nesting limit.
- Edit per-build settings with `idf.py -B <dir> menuconfig` (under "ESP32
  Device SDK"). Don't commit a generated `sdkconfig`: it's gitignored for a reason.
- OTA is off by default (`CONFIG_HOMEHUB_OTA_ENABLED=n`, version `999.0.0`),
  except on boards with the full UI. Set a version with `-DPROJECT_VER=1.0.0` or
  `version.txt`.
- Don't move offsets in `partitions.csv`. `prod_data` and `prod_bak` are fixed
  manufacturing locations, and the table offset of `0x10000` leaves room for a
  larger Secure Boot bootloader. Check the `check_sizes` line in the build
  output: app slots are 2 MB (4 MB on Muse).

## Adding a command

Muse calls a gadget's commands by name: the firmware lists them in
`link.register` and answers each `link.invoke`. A command you add lives in two
places, which must use the same name. (`device.health` and `device.ota` are
handled in `noise_control.cpp` itself; everything else goes through
`on_ws_command()`.)

1. **Advertise it** in `build_register_json()` in `main/noise_control.cpp`:
   `add_command(commands, "relay.set", "<description>", required, optional)`.
   `required` and `optional` map each parameter's name to `{type,
   description}` (`string_param()` makes a string one). Muse reads the
   descriptions, so say what the command does and what it returns. If it can
   take longer than the default 30 seconds, set its `timeout_ms`, as
   `device.discover` does.
2. **Handle it** in `on_ws_command()` in `main/app.c`. Return
   `{"ok": true, "payload": {...}}`, or `command_error(code, message)` for a
   failure. Only `ok`, `payload` (or a `payload_json` string) and the
   error's `message` reach the Muse. Always return a result: `NULL` reaches
   the Muse as a generic "command handler did not return a result" error.
   Validate the parameters yourself: `params` is `NULL` when the request has
   none, and the firmware doesn't check them against the advertised
   `required` and `optional`, so check each one's presence, type, length and
   allowed values.
3. **Don't block.** `on_ws_command()` runs on the Noise session's task, so
   anything slow (the network, a slow sensor, a camera) belongs in its own
   task. Copy `request_id`, `session_generation` and every parameter the task
   needs, strings included, into memory the task owns (`device.discover`
   uses `cJSON_Duplicate()`): the request is freed as soon as
   `on_ws_command()` returns. If an allocation or the task start fails, free
   what you allocated and return `command_error()`. Otherwise start the task
   and return `{"_async": true}`. The task then calls
   `noise_ctrl_send_command_result()` once, failures included, or the Muse
   waits out the timeout. It takes ownership of the result and frees it, so
   don't free or reuse it afterwards. `camera.capture` and `device.discover`
   work this way. A result from an earlier session is dropped.
4. **Gate it on a Kconfig option** in `main/Kconfig.projbuild` when it needs
   particular hardware, and wrap both places in the same `#if`, as
   `sensors.read` does with `CONFIG_HOMEHUB_SENSECAP_SENSORS`. Add new source
   files to `main/CMakeLists.txt`.
5. **Keep `link.register` small.** It's printed into at most 8 KB, and a
   device whose registration doesn't fit never registers.
6. **Add a host test** in `tests/`. `test_link_sensecap_sensors.py` checks
   that `sensors.read` is advertised and dispatched under the same option, and
   runs its parser against a harness.

Report environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2, tVOC, light and so
on) through `sensors.read`, on every board that has them, so Muse has one
command to call wherever it runs. Don't add them to `device.health`, which is
for the link itself (battery, power, network), or give them a board-specific
command. Return each reading as `{value, unit, age_s}`, as
`sensecap_sensors.c` does, and report a sensor with no recent reading as null.
Read slow or I2C sensors in a background task and have `sensors.read` return
the latest value.

Muse sees the command once the board reconnects with the new firmware. Keep
the management commands that `on_ws_command()` also handles (`device.list_vms`,
`device.set_vm`, `device.reset_vm` and `device.unpair`) out of
`link.register`: `tests/test_link_transport_contract.py` checks they stay
unadvertised.

## Say Muse, never Hatch

Users never see the name Hatch.

- Anything a person reads says Muse, the Muse app, or the Muse's name:
  - screen text and error captions (`CAN'T REACH MUSE`, not `CAN'T REACH HATCH`)
  - settings labels
  - Kconfig prompts and help
  - log lines
  - tool and script output
  - docs
- Don't use `hatch` in a new file name or identifier. Use `muse` or
  `muse_gadget`. The Muse chat code is `components/muse/muse_chat*`.
- The ESP32 account clients use `https://api.muse.ai`, or the `api_url_v2`
  base the app sends during pairing, with bare API paths. They ignore
  `api_url`: only older firmware reads it, and that firmware adds `/hatch/`
  itself. Keep saving it so a device flashed back to older firmware still works.
- `hatch` stays only where the server or the Muse app depends on it. Don't
  rename these:
  - the VM host `hatch.metaaivm.com`
  - the `hatch_refresh:` auth prefix, the `hatch-web` app id and the
    `HatchLink/` user agent
  - pairing labels and ids such as `hatch-link-pairing-v%d`, the `hatch_link`
    model and the `hatch-link:` device id
  - the bug report fields
  - the setup commands (`hatch.token` and the rest) and the `"hatch"` key
    in the status JSON, which the app and older tools use
- Some older identifiers still carry the name (`muse_hatch_*`,
  `MUSE_HATCH_*`, `CONFIG_MUSE_HATCH`). Leave them unless you're asked to
  rename them. Don't copy the name into new code.

## Tests

These are host-side Python unittest harnesses that compile the firmware C/C++
against fakes, with no board or IDF environment required:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run one `idf.py build` first: `test_link_discovery` compiles cJSON from
`managed_components/`, and that directory only exists after a build. Set `CC`
or `CXX` to change compilers.

Two tests skip quietly when their inputs are missing; check the summary for
`skipped=`:

- `test_noise_core` links against the host's PSA Crypto library, found with
  `pkg-config mbedcrypto`. Install `libmbedtls-dev` and `pkg-config` on Debian
  or Ubuntu (as CI does), or `mbedtls` and `pkgconf` with Homebrew.
- `test_link_pairing_handshake` builds Mbed TLS from source for its
  real-crypto case, so it needs `IDF_PATH` (set by `export.sh`) or
  `MBEDTLS_SOURCE_DIR`.

## Before you hand back work

1. `idf.py build` (and the board build you touched) passes, with the size check
   under the slot limit.
2. The host tests pass.
3. If you flashed, the boot log reaches `starting`, and the log shows no
   panic or reboot loop.
